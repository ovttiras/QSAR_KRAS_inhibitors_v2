        "1. Sampling: The algorithm explores many possible positions and orientations (or \"poses\") of the ligand within the receptor's active site. In AutoDock Vina, smina, and gnina, conformations are generated using Monte Carlo Sampling.\n",
        "2. Scoring: Each generated pose is evaluated using a scoring function which estimates the binding affinity. Poses are then ranked on these scores. For Vina scores, lower energy scores indicating more favorable interactions.\n",

These deep learning models analyze a 3D grid representation of the protein-ligand complex, essentially evaluating a \"picture\" of the interaction based on atomic densities.\n",

        "By default, gnina uses results from the CNN for **rescoring**, meaning that poses are initially sampled and scored with the traditional Vina scoring function but re-ranked after sampling using CNN models.
